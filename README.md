### App Functionality

- All application state is managed by the Redux store. State-based props are mapped from the store rather than stored as component state.

- Updates are triggered by dispatching actions to reducers.
Reducers and actions are written properly and correctly return updated state to the store.

- Listed posts are displayed with title, author, number of comments, current score, and a voting mechanism to upvote or downvote the post. Posts should have buttons or links for editing or deleting that post.

- The voting mechanism works and correctly displays the new vote score after clicking.

- List posts link to the detail page for that post.

- All posts are listed at the root.

- All posts for a category are listed at /:category

- The voting mechanism works and correctly displays the new vote score after clicking.

- List pages (root or category) include a mechanism for sorting by date or by score (at a minimum) and the sort works properly.

- Post is displayed with title, body, author, number of comments, current score and voting mechanism. Post should have buttons or links for editing or deleting that post.

- Listed comments are displayed with author, current score, and a voting mechanism to upvote or downvote the post. Comments should have buttons or links for editing or deleting that comment.

- The voting mechanism works and correctly displays the new vote score after clicking for both the post and comments.

- The voting mechanism works and correctly displays the new vote score after clicking.

- All comments for a post are displayed below the post body.

- A mechanism for adding a new comment is visible on the detail page and functional.

- Application has a form for creating a new post. Submitting the form properly adds the post to the correct category.

- Application has a form for adding comments to a post. Submitting the form properly adds the comment to the correct post.

- Edit buttons for posts/comments open a form with existing data pre-populated. Submitting the form correctly updates the data for the comment/post.

- A mechanism for deleting posts and comments exists. Clicking the button/link correctly removes the post/comment from list view and makes post inaccessible at it's URL.
